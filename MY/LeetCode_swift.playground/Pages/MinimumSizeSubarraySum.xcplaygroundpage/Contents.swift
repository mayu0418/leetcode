 * Question Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/
 * Primary idea: Two Pointers, anchor the former and move forward the latter one to ensure the sum of subarray just covers the target
 * Note: There could be no valid subarray which sum >= target
 * Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1)
 *Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

 Example:

 Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
 Output: 2
 Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
 Follow up:
 If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n).

            currentSum += num
            
            while currentSum >= s, start <= i {
                miniSize = min(miniSize, i - start + 1)
                
                currentSum -= nums[start]
